# Eclipse RCP Cookbook

This repository contains the sources of the **Eclipse 4 RCP Cookbook**.

The branches contain the different steps, so by switching the branches, the steps to reach the state in the master branch can be followed.

## Recipe #1 - The Basic Recipe

This is the basic recipe to get started with an Eclipse Application, the basic concepts and best practices.

The original blog post can be found here: [Eclipse RCP Cookbook – Basic Recipe](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2015/02/eclipse-rcp-cookbook-basic-recipe/)  
The updated version is contained in this repository in [Basic Recipe](/tutorials/Eclipse_RCP_Cookbook_Basic_Recipe.md)

## Recipe #2 - The Food Combining Recipe (OSGi Declarative Services and Events)

This is the _food combining_ recipe, that separates and decouples different parts of the application. It does this by making use of OSGi Declarative Services and OSGi Events.

The original blog post can be found here: [OSGi declarative services and the event bus – Eclipse RCP Cookbook](https://www.codecentric.de/wissens-hub/blog/osgi-declarative-services-and-the-event-bus-eclipse-rcp-cookbook)  
The updated version is contained in this repository in [Food Combining Recipe](/tutorials/Eclipse_RCP_Cookbook_Services_Events.md)

## Recipe #3 - The Thermomix Recipe (Automated build with Maven Tycho)

This is the _Thermomix_ recipe, which actually means that we add the ability to build the Eclipse application without UI integration. To explain the _Thermomix_ analogy, it means that we put everything together in one place and press a button to get the final meal at the end without interaction. :-)

The tutorial is contained in this repository in [Thermomix Recipe](/tutorials/Eclipse_RCP_Cookbook_Tycho.md)

## Recipe #4 - The Topping Recipe (Add p2 update functionality)

This is the _Topping Recipe_, which means that we add the ability to update the Eclipse application with additional functions or bugfixes via an update mechanism. For this we use _Eclipse Equinox p2 _ and integrate it into our application.

The original blog post can be found here: [Add p2 update functionality to an Eclipse 4 application – Eclipse RCP Cookbook](https://www.codecentric.de/wissens-hub/blog/add-p2-update-functionality-to-an-eclipse-4-application-eclipse-rcp-cookbook)  
The updated version is contained in this repository in [Topping Recipe](/tutorials/Eclipse_RCP_Cookbook_p2.md)

## Recipe #5 - The Decoration Recipe (Eclipse Preferences)

This is the _Decoration Recipe_, which means that we add the functionality that a user can change the behavior or the look&feel of an application by changing preferences. This is done by using Eclipse Preferences with a custom plugin that adapts a plain E4 preferences mechanism.

The tutorial is contained in this repository in [Decoration Recipe](/tutorials/Eclipse_RCP_Cookbook_Preferences.md)
